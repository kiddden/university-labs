# Lab Name: Real Estate Prices in Kyiv

## Description
In this lab, we will explore real estate prices in Kyiv by reading data from an Excel file, calculating the average price for each station, and plotting the results on a graph. We will use the pandas and matplotlib libraries in Python for data analysis and visualization.

## Project Structure

### Data
The data used in this lab is stored in an Excel file named `dataset.xlsx`. It contains information about real estate prices for different stations in Kyiv.

### Implementation
The implementation of the lab is provided in a Python script named `lab1.py`. The script reads the data from the Excel file, calculates the mean price for each station using the pandas library, and plots the results on a graph using the matplotlib library.
