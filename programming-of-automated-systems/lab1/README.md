# Project Title: Modified Nearest Neighbor Classifier on Iris Dataset

## Task Description

The goal of this lab is to implement a modified Nearest Neighbor classifier on the Iris dataset. The classifier will use cosine distance as a similarity measure, and the implementation should not use any external libraries such as sklearn. The classifier will be trained and tested using a holdout approach, with a train-test split of 90%-10%.
## Project Structure
- **Data**: The dataset used in this project is the well-known Iris dataset. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). The dataset is available in a CSV file named `iris.csv`.

- **Implementation**: The implementation of the modified Nearest Neighbor classifier is provided in a Python script named `lab2.py`. It includes functions for data preprocessing, training, and testing the classifier, as well as calculating its accuracy.

- **Results**: The accuracy of the classifier is calculated and displayed as a percentage.
